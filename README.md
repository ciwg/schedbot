# schedbot

Snapshot of commit history of hacked-together python script used for
syncing MCP docs and sched for NOMCON 2020-2022.  Extracted from a
private repo that contains config and pickled db, so not intended to
be runnable as-is.  Really needs to be replaced by integrating
functionality into docbot or equivalent.
